Single-frame InfraRed Small Target-V2 (SIRST-V2) Benchmark
==============

A dataset proposed in "One-Stage Cascade Refinement Networks for Infrared Small Target Detection"

## Dataset Description

SIRST-V2 is a dataset specially constructed for **single-frame** infrared small target detection, in which the images are selected from thousands of infrared sequences for different scenarios.
